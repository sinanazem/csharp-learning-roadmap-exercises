5. **Database Interaction**
   - Entity Framework Core
   - Database Design

6. **Testing**
   - Unit Testing with NUnit

7. **Real-world Projects**
   - Apply your skills to real-world scenarios.

## Code Samples

Explore the `src` directory for code samples related to each topic. Each folder is self-contained, containing code examples and explanations to help you understand the concepts better.

- [src/variables-and-operators](src/variables-and-operators)
- [src/object-oriented-programming](src/object-oriented-programming)
- [src/advanced-topics](src/advanced-topics)
- [src/web-development](src/web-development)
- [src/database-interaction](src/database-interaction)
- [src/testing](src/testing)
- [src/real-world-projects](src/real-world-projects)

## Exercises

Challenge yourself with hands-on exercises to reinforce your learning. Each exercise comes with a starter code and a solution:

- [exercises/exercise-1](exercises/exercise-1)
- [exercises/exercise-2](exercises/exercise-2)
- [exercises/exercise-3](exercises/exercise-3)
